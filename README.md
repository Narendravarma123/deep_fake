Introduction
Deep Fake Video Detection aims to identify videos that have been manipulated using artificial intelligence to alter someone's appearance or voice. These manipulated videos can be used for malicious purposes, spreading misinformation, or creating realistic hoaxes. Our project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to detect such alterations and ensure content authenticity.

Features
Accurate detection of deep fake videos
Utilizes state-of-the-art neural network architectures
User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing videos
Real-time detection capabilities
Comprehensive performance metrics and visualizations
Demo


You can watch a live demo of the project here.

Installation
The dataset is not provided here. We collected various datasets and combined them into a single one.

Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Narendravarma/deep_fake.git
cd deep-fake-detection
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

sh
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the pre-trained models and place them in the models/ directory. (Provide instructions or links to the models)

Run the application:

sh
Copy code
python app.py
Usage
To detect deep fakes in a video, navigate to the application interface in your browser.
Upload a video file or provide a URL to a video.
Click on the 'Analyze' button to start the detection process.
View the results, including detection probabilities and visualizations, on the results page.
Dataset
The project uses the DFDC (Deep Fake Detection Challenge) dataset. This dataset contains thousands of real and fake videos, along with their labels.

Ensure you have access to the dataset and place it in the data/ directory.

Model
We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture based on EfficientNet. The model was trained on the DFDC dataset with the following specifications:

Optimizer: Adam
Learning Rate: Scheduling learning rate
Batch Size: 32/64
Number of Epochs: 50/100/150
For more details, refer to the model training script.

Results
[[41 18]
 [16 45]]
True positive =  41
False positive =  18
False negative =  16
True negative =  45
