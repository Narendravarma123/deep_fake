Introduction
A brief introduction to your project, explaining what deep fake videos are and why detecting them is important.

markdown
Copy code
Deep Fake Video Detection aims to identify videos that have been manipulated using artificial intelligence to alter someone's appearance or voice. These manipulated videos can be used for malicious purposes, spreading misinformation, or creating realistic hoaxes. Our project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to detect such alterations and ensure content authenticity.
Features
Highlight the key features of your project.

markdown

Installation
Step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up your project locally.

markdown
Copy code
The dataset is not provided here(We collected various datasets and combined them into a single one
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Narendravarma/deep_fake.git
    cd deep-fake-detection
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the pre-trained models and place them in the `models/` directory. (Provide instructions or links to the models)

5. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
Usage
Guide on how to use the project once it's set up.

markdown
Copy code
1. To detect deep fakes in a video, navigate to the application interface in your browser.
2. Upload a video file or provide a URL to a video.
3. Click on the 'Analyze' button to start the detection process.
4. View the results, including detection probabilities and visualizations, on the results page.



## Dataset
Information about the dataset used for training and testing your models.

```markdown
The project uses the [DFDC (Deep Fake Detection Challenge)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge) dataset. This dataset contains thousands of real and fake videos, along with their labels.

Ensure you have access to the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory:
Model
Details about the model architecture, training process, and any hyperparameters used.

markdown
Copy code
We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture based on EfficientNet. The model was trained on the DFDC dataset with the following specifications:

- Optimizer: Adam
- Learning Rate: Scheduling learning rate
- Batch Size: 32/64
- Number of Epochs: 50

For more details, refer to the [model training script](path/to/training_script.py).
Results
Showcase the results of your project, including accuracy, precision, recall, and any other relevant metrics. Include visualizations if possible.

markdown
